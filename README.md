# How to Use Dolby.io Video Conferencing with Angular

This repository contains code sample code for building a video conferencing application using Angular and Dolby.io Communications API. It features screen sharing, chat, and participant management. 

## Overview
Following the instructions of [How to Use Video Conferencing with Angular](https://dolby.io/blog/how-to-use-dolby-io-video-conferencing-with-angular/), this tutorial is a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Dolby.io video conferencing with Angular web applications. It covers everything from setting up a development environment to implementing video conferencing functionality using the Dolby.io API.

## Requirements 
There are several requirements to follow along with this tutorial: 
- Node.js and npm must be installed on your machine. 
- Angular CLI must be installed to generate and run the Angular app. 
- Any modern web browser to run and test the application

## Getting Started 
As part of enabling Dolby.io's audio processing capabilities, you would need to sign up for a [Dolby.io account](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup/). You receive 50GBs to start out for free, which should help you get started with this project. 

Once inside the dashboard, make sure you create an app to acquire the API key and secret token. For more information on how to navigate the dashboard, [read here](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/overview-developer-tools).
